# IE 6600: Computation and Visualization for Analytics

This repository contains my work for the course IE 6600: Computation and Visualization for Analytics. It brings together hands-on projects that apply computational methods and visualization techniques to explore data, uncover insights, and communicate results clearly.

## About Me
I am developing skills in analytics and visualization with a focus on turning data into actionable insight. Through these projects, I practice end-to-end workflows—from data preparation to modeling and visual storytelling—using Python.

## Course Overview
IE 6600 introduces core concepts and practical tools for data exploration, knowledge discovery, data storytelling, and decision making across domains such as engineering, healthcare operations, and manufacturing. The course covers the basics of Python for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization and emphasizes both static and interactive charts, with attention to color encoding, shape selection, spatial layout, and annotation to reveal patterns, interactions, and comparisons.

## Projects
Each project folder includes a Jupyter notebook (`Code.ipynb`) and a written report (`Report.pdf`).

- Project 1: [Folder](Project%201/) — [Code.ipynb](Project%201/Code.ipynb) | [Report.pdf](Project%201/Report.pdf)
- Project 2: [Folder](Project%202/) — [Code.ipynb](Project%202/Code.ipynb) | [Report.pdf](Project%202/Report.pdf)
- Project 3: [Folder](Project%203/) — [Code.ipynb](Project%203/Code.ipynb) | [Report.pdf](Project%203/Report.pdf)

## Getting Started
- Open the project notebooks in Jupyter to view code and outputs.
- Refer to the accompanying reports for context, methodology, findings, and conclusions.

## Technologies
- Python for data preparation, analysis, and visualization
- Static and interactive visualization techniques

## Libraries and Tools
- pandas for data manipulation and aggregation
- numpy for numerical operations
- matplotlib and seaborn for static charts and statistical plots
- plotly (express and graph objects) for interactive visualizations
- scikit-learn for clustering (e.g., KMeans)
- Jupyter Notebook for reproducible analysis

## Techniques
- Data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and descriptive statistics
- Grouping, aggregation, and pivoting to summarize patterns
- Correlation analysis and pairwise exploration
- Time series exploration (trend and seasonality)
- Unsupervised learning with clustering to discover structure

## Visualizations
- Static: line charts, bar charts, histograms, box plots, scatter plots, heatmaps
- Interactive: Plotly-based line, bar, and scatter charts with tooltips and filtering

## What I Learnt
- How to translate business and domain questions into analytical workflows
- Selecting effective visual encodings and layouts to communicate insights
- Building reproducible notebooks that combine code, narrative, and visuals
- When to use static versus interactive charts for different audiences
- Applying clustering to segment data and guide interpretation
